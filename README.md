# BilliAgeCheck
The idea for this project is to scrape readily available live Forbes information of the current top billionaires (in terms of net worth) and use that data to create a visual (line plot) that shows which age groups contain the most billionaires. The goal of this project is to learn more about web scraping with Python, the pandas library, and use of databases to create visual representations.
